# titanic-spacecraft-competition-kaggle
This Python project aims to tackle the Titanic Spacecraft competition hosted on Kaggle, utilizing machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival based on various features. The project achieves above-average performance by employing a sophisticated approach, including grid search cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization and leveraging predict_proba to reduce the Brier Score error.

Features
Python Code: The project is implemented in Python, taking advantage of its rich ecosystem of libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

Machine Learning Model: The core of the project involves building a machine learning model to predict passenger survival. The model is trained on the provided Titanic dataset, using features such as passengerID, VIP, age, gender, and more.

Grid Search Cross-Validation: Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in optimizing machine learning models. The project employs grid search cross-validation to systematically explore a range of hyperparameter values, ensuring the best possible performance of the model.

Brier Score Reduction with predict_proba: The Brier Score is a metric used to evaluate probabilistic predictions. Leveraging the predict_proba method allows the model to output probability estimates, enabling a more nuanced evaluation and reduction of the Brier Score error.
